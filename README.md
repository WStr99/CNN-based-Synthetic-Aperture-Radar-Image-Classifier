# CNN-based-Synthetic-Aperture-Radar-image-classifier
This project focuses on detecting and classifying Soviet military vehicles in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images using the YOLOv8 object detection framework. The data originates from U.S. military satellite-based SAR systems and is annotated in PASCAL VOC format, which is converted to YOLO format for training.
